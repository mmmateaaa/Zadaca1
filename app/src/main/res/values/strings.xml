    <string name="gHopperDesc">Grace Murray Hopper was an American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. She was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer in 1944, and invented the first compiler for a computer programming language, and the one of those who popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, one of the first high-level programming languages.</string>

    <string name="jVNeumannBirth">Died at 54 (1903-1957)</string>
    <string name="jVNeumannDesc">Wrote a paper on the idea that programs should be stored in memory along with the data. Previous to this, programs were \"hardwired\" into the architecture of the computer. This became known as the von Neumann architecture and is the basis for virtually all modern computers.</string>
    <string name="aTuringName">Alan Turing</string>

    <string name="aTuringDesc">Alan Mathison Turing, OBE, FRS was a British pioneering computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, mathematical biologist, and marathon and ultra distance runner. He was highly influential in the development of computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of \"algorithm\" and \"computation\" with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer.</string>
