# Homework no.1
Homework that refer to the lab 1 (RMA)

### The assignment and problems encountered
On my first homework application I figured that on the first screen would be a button that will open a list of Computer engineers when someone clicks. As a result, my default Main Activity contains only one button which has a method that on someone's click open a new InspiringPerson Activity. Starting one Activity from another is possible using Intent, and on that way I did my button works.

InspiringPerson Activity was created additionally by me. In my activity_inspiring_person.xml layout, for each person, I used ImageView and three TextViews. My strings, styles, dimensions, etc. I defined in .xml files that are located in values folder. In my InspiringPersonActivity.java class, I created and calling a method for showing Toast message. My Toast message is a String which is caught from string.xml file by using setString() method.
